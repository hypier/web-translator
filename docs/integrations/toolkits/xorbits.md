# Xorbits

This notebook shows how to use agents to interact with [Xorbits Pandas](https://doc.xorbits.io/en/latest/reference/pandas/index.html) dataframe and [Xorbits Numpy](https://doc.xorbits.io/en/latest/reference/numpy/index.html) ndarray. It is mostly optimized for question answering.

**NOTE: this agent calls the `Python` agent under the hood, which executes LLM generated Python code - this can be bad if the LLM generated Python code is harmful. Use cautiously.**

## Pandas examples


```python
import xorbits.pandas as pd
from langchain_experimental.agents.agent_toolkits import create_xorbits_agent
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```


```python
data = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")
agent = create_xorbits_agent(OpenAI(temperature=0), data, verbose=True)
```

```output
  0%|          |   0.00/100 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
```


```python
agent.run("How many rows and columns are there?")
```
```output
