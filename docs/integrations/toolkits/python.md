# Python

This notebook showcases an agent designed to write and execute `Python` code to answer a question.


```python
from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain_experimental.tools import PythonREPLTool
```

## Create the tool(s)


```python
tools = [PythonREPLTool()]
```

## Using OpenAI Functions Agent

This is probably the most reliable type of agent, but is only compatible with function calling


```python
from langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
instructions = """You are an agent designed to write and execute python code to answer questions.
You have access to a python REPL, which you can use to execute python code.
If you get an error, debug your code and try again.
Only use the output of your code to answer the question. 
You might know the answer without running any code, but you should still run the code to get the answer.
If it does not seem like you can write code to answer the question, just return "I don't know" as the answer.
"""
base_prompt = hub.pull("langchain-ai/openai-functions-template")
prompt = base_prompt.partial(instructions=instructions)
```


```python
agent = create_openai_functions_agent(ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), tools, prompt)
```


```python
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

## Using ReAct Agent

This is a less reliable type, but is compatible with most models


```python
from langchain.agents import create_react_agent
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
```


```python
instructions = """You are an agent designed to write and execute python code to answer questions.
You have access to a python REPL, which you can use to execute python code.

"""
base_prompt = hub.pull("langchain-ai/react-agent-template")
prompt = base_prompt.partial(instructions=instructions)
```


```python
agent = create_react_agent(ChatAnthropic(temperature=0), tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

## Fibonacci Example
This example was created by [John Wiseman](https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1628270074074398720?s=20).


```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "What is the 10th fibonacci number?"})
```
```output


[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3m Sure, I can write some Python code to get the 10th Fibonacci number.

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: Python_REPL  
Action Input: 
def fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

print(fib(10))
```
[0m[36;1m[1;3m55
[0m[32;1m[1;3m Let me break this down step-by-step:

1. I defined a fibonacci function called `fib` that takes in a number `n`. 
2. Inside the function, I initialized two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, which are the first two Fibonacci numbers.
3. Then I used a for loop to iterate up to `n`, updating `a` and `b` each iteration to the next Fibonacci numbers.
4. Finally, I return `a`, which after `n` iterations, contains the `n`th Fibonacci number.

5. I called `fib(10)` to get the 10th Fibonacci number and printed the result.

The key parts are defining the fibonacci calculation in the function, and then calling it with the desired input index to print the output.

The observation shows the 10th Fibonacci number is 55, so that is the final answer.

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
Final Answer: 55

## Training neural net
This example was created by [Samee Ur Rehman](https://twitter.com/sameeurehman/status/1630130518133207046?s=20).


```python
agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "input": """Understand, write a single neuron neural network in PyTorch.
Take synthetic data for y=2x. Train for 1000 epochs and print every 100 epochs.
Return prediction for x = 5"""
    }
)
