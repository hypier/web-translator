# Upstash Vector

> [Upstash Vector](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/whatisvector) is a serverless vector database designed for working with vector embeddings.
>
> The vector langchain integration is a wrapper around the [upstash-vector](https://github.com/upstash/vector-py) package.
>
> The python package uses the [vector rest api](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/api/get-started) behind the scenes.

## Installation

Create a free vector database from [upstash console](https://console.upstash.com/vector) with the desired dimensions and distance metric.

You can then create an `UpstashVectorStore` instance by:

- Providing the environment variables `UPSTASH_VECTOR_URL` and `UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN`

- Giving them as parameters to the constructor

- Passing an Upstash Vector `Index` instance to the constructor

Also, an `Embeddings` instance is required to turn given texts into embeddings. Here we use `OpenAIEmbeddings` as an example


```python
%pip install langchain-openai langchain langchain-community upstash-vector
```


```python
import os

from langchain_community.vectorstores.upstash import UpstashVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR_OPENAI_KEY>"
os.environ["UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL"] = "<YOUR_UPSTASH_VECTOR_URL>"
os.environ["UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN"] = "<YOUR_UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN>"

# Create an embeddings instance
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Create a vector store instance
store = UpstashVectorStore(embedding=embeddings)
```

An alternative way of creating `UpstashVectorStore` is to [create an Upstash Vector index by selecting a model](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/embeddingmodels#using-a-model) and passing `embedding=True`. In this configuration, documents or queries will be sent to Upstash as text and embedded there.

```python
store = UpstashVectorStore(embedding=True)
```

If you are interested in trying out this approach, you can update the initialization of `store` like above and run the rest of the tutorial.

## Load documents

Load an example text file and split it into chunks which can be turned into vector embeddings.


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

docs[:3]
```





## Inserting documents

The vectorstore embeds text chunks using the embedding object and batch inserts them into the database. This returns an id array of the inserted vectors.


```python
inserted_vectors = store.add_documents(docs)

inserted_vectors[:5]
```



```output
['82b3781b-817c-4a4d-8f8b-cbd07c1d005a',

```


## Querying

The database can be queried using a vector or a text prompt.
If a text prompt is used, it's first converted into embedding and then queried.

The `k` parameter specifies how many results to return from the query.


```python
result = store.similarity_search("The United States of America", k=5)
result
```





```python
result = store.similarity_search("dystopia", k=3, filter="year < 2000")
result
```





## Querying with score

The score of the query can be included for every result. 

> The score returned in the query requests is a normalized value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest similarity and 0 the lowest regardless of the similarity function used. For more information look at the [docs](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/features#vector-similarity-functions).


```python
result = store.similarity_search_with_score("The United States of America", k=5)

for doc, score in result:
    print(f"{doc.metadata} - {score}")
```
```output
{'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'} - 0.87391514
{'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'} - 0.8549463
{'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'} - 0.847913
{'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'} - 0.84328896
{'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'} - 0.832347
```
## Deleting vectors

Vectors can be deleted by their ids


```python
store.delete(inserted_vectors)
```

## Clearing the vector database

This will clear the vector database


```python
store.delete(delete_all=True)
```

## Getting info about vector database

You can get information about your database like the distance metric dimension using the info function.

> When an insert happens, the database an indexing takes place. While this is happening new vectors can not be queried. `pendingVectorCount` represents the number of vector that are currently being indexed. 


```python
store.info()
```



```output
InfoResult(vector_count=42, pending_vector_count=0, index_size=6470, dimension=384, similarity_function='COSINE')
```
